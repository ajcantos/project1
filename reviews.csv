39,4,"I was a little worried about picking up this book. But I was surprised and immediately swept away: the writing is precise, clear, and lyrical. It rings like a bell calling you back for more."
40,5,Perfect. I'm not exagerating: this book is perfect. Can I give it six stars?
41,3,"I liked it at the start, but then it became something of a slog. Also, there seemed to be quite a bit of incessant redundancy of facts, as though the author had forgotten that he had added these facts earlier and just entered them again, and then never went back to see that he was repeating himself. Overall, it was a good book, but not as good as I hoped."
42,1,"This book honestly bored me. This has been recommended to me so many times over the years and unfortunately, I paid money to try and read it. I should have just checked it out of the library. Over descriptive and slow."
43,3,Overall a good book with a very sad story to tell. The middle of the book was a little longer than it had to be in my opinion but still a fascinating story!

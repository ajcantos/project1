4,1,"This book honestly bored me. This has been recommended to me so many times over the years and unfortunately, I paid money to try and read it. I should have just checked it out of the library. Over descriptive and slow."
5,3,Overall a good book with a very sad story to tell. The middle of the book was a little longer than it had to be in my opinion but still a fascinating story!

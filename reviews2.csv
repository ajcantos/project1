2,5,Perfect. I'm not exagerating: this book is perfect. Can I give it six stars?
3,3,"I liked it at the start, but then it became something of a slog. Also, there seemed to be quite a bit of incessant redundancy of facts, as though the author had forgotten that he had added these facts earlier and just entered them again, and then never went back to see that he was repeating himself. Overall, it was a good book, but not as good as I hoped."
